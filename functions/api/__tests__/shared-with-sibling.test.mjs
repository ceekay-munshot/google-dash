/**
 * Files meant to be identical in both dashboards must stay identical.
 *
 * google-dash and AI-Compute-Pricing read the same Cloudflare KV store and
 * publish overlapping figures. Several modules are deliberately the same file
 * in both, so the two sites cannot give different answers about the same data.
 *
 * They drifted anyway, and it reached readers. `_gpu-price-basis.js` gained a
 * linked-growth path on one side only: for the same SKU and the same month,
 * one dashboard printed +15.15% while the other printed a blank whose tooltip
 * said the two periods were "not comparable" — a statement its sibling
 * disproved with the same stored data. `pricing-history.js` drifted the other
 * way: one copy was rebuilt onto the measure-aware path while the other kept
 * publishing the 2026-07-10 change of measure as a price cut.
 *
 * A divergence here is not a merge conflict to resolve later. It is two
 * public answers to one question.
 *
 * If a file genuinely must differ, remove it from SHARED and say why — do not
 * relax the comparison.
