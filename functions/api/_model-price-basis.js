/**
 * Model price basis — every read of a model price, detection of the days the
 * source changed WHAT it reports, and the refusal of growth across them.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ───────────────
 * Every model-pricing figure on the dashboard comes from pricepertoken's
 * per-model daily history. On 2026-07-10 the reported price of 13 Google and
 * 10 OpenAI models fell on the same day, every one of them to EXACTLY half of
 * its previous figure. Gemini 2.5 Pro had read $1.25 per 1M input tokens for a
 * year and read $0.625 from that morning; GPT-5 mini went from $0.25 to
 * $0.125. Two unrelated vendors do not reprice two dozen models by one
 * identical factor on one day. That is the source changing which price it
 * reports — a change of measure, not a market repricing.
 *
 * The dashboard reported it as one: "Biggest price cut: Google -19.5%" for
 * 2026-Q3, OpenAI -11.9% QoQ, -35% month-on-month in July on the touched
 * peer-matrix rows and a further -22.5% in August (July's average blended
 * both measures, so August "fell" from the blend), and -50% YoY. Those are
 * exactly the numbers a customer escalates, and none of them happened in the
 * market.
 *
 * Why not read the rows' original_* fields instead? They never move. For every
 * Google model across the whole history they hold the model's first captured
 * price — a fixed reference the source's own percentage columns are computed
 * against, not a live list price. Reading them would flatten every price line
 * and erase the real repricings along with the artefact.
 *
 * This module is modelled on _gpu-price-basis.js, which solves the same
 * problem for the GPU feed's 2026-07-28 change: find the change from the data,
 * tag every observation with the measure it sits on, average each period on
 * one measure, and LINK growth between periods on different measures — a
 * model the change moved is compared at its reported price times the inverse
 * of the exact factor, which is its figure on the earlier measure. Growth is
 * refused only where a model has no earlier figure to link to. (This summary
 * said "refuse" after the linking work landed; the detail below was correct.)
 *
 * HOW A CHANGE OF MEASURE IS TOLD APART FROM A REAL PRICE CUT
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A single model's step proves nothing. A model halving its price on its own
 * is an ordinary price cut, and the history has real ones: Gemini 3.6 Flash
 * halved alone on 2026-08-14, GPT-5 halved for a week in September 2025. What
 * marks a change of measure is the DAY, not the model:
 *
 *   - at least MIN_EVENT_MODELS standard SKUs step by exactly one factor
 *     (x0.5, or x2) on the same date, all in the same direction, and
 *   - at every provider counted, those exact steps are at least
 *     MIN_EVENT_EXACT_SHARE of that provider's own price moves that day.
 *
 * The share is judged per provider, never across the whole request: an
 * unrelated provider repricing on the same day says nothing about what the
 * source did to Google's rows, and a request-wide share would make the verdict
 * depend on which providers happened to be fetched (the pricing matrix reads
 * eight, the peer matrix three).
 *
 * 2026-07-10 clears both by a wide margin: 13 of 13 Google moves and 10 of 11
 * OpenAI moves are exact halvings. Nothing else in the Google, OpenAI or
 * Anthropic history comes close — the next-largest cluster is four new OpenAI
 * SKUs on 2026-07-28, and a day with mixed directions (2026-08-18: four
 * doublings and two halvings inside one new product family) is a repricing,
 * not a switch of measure.
 *
 * Only once a DATE qualifies is any model examined, and a model is touched by
 * the change only if its OWN price stepped by that exact factor, in that
 * direction, across that date. Models priced straight through the date without
 * moving (GPT-5, GPT-4o, every Gemma, all of Anthropic) are untouched and
 * compare normally on both sides.
 *
 * A model first listed ON or AFTER the date, at a provider the change touched,
 * is placed on the new measure from its first day. It has no earlier price
 * to prove otherwise, and the source reports it the way it now reports that
 * provider — GPT-5.6 Sol, listed on the day of the change, must not be
 * compared with GPT-5.5 Pro's pre-change figure as if the two were the same
 * measure (that comparison read -91.7%). At a provider the change never
 * touched (Anthropic), a new model is simply untouched.
 *
 * The date is DETECTED, not hard-coded — no constant in this module holds
 * 2026-07-10, and the tests find it from fixture rows alone. One
 * vendor's rows are enough to find it (Google alone shows 13 of 13 moves
 * exact that day; OpenAI alone 10 of 11), so a response in which the other
 * provider failed to load still refuses the comparison rather than quietly
 * printing the phantom cut. The same rule would find the next such change with
 * no code change.
 *
 * A touched model that later steps back by the exact inverse factor, onto
 * exactly the figure it carried before the change, has gone back to the old
 * measure (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image Preview: $0.50, $0.25 on 2026-07-10, $0.50
 * again on 2026-07-27). Reporting that as a +100% price rise would be the same
 * artefact in reverse, so it is treated as a return to the earlier measure and
 * growth across it is refused as well.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS TO THE NUMBERS
 * ───────────────────────────
 *   Levels   A period's average rests on ONE measure. Where a period straddles
 *            a change, the measure holding most of the touched models'
 *            observations wins — ties go to the newer one, which is what the
 *            source publishes going forward — and the rest are left out and
 *            counted, never blended: a blend of $1.25 and $0.625 describes
 *            nothing. Untouched models always count. Nothing is rescaled: a
 *            figure after the change is exactly what the source now reports.
 *   Growth   QoQ, MoM and YoY between periods on different measures are
 *            LINKED: a model the change moved is compared at its reported
 *            price times the inverse of the exact factor the change applied
 *            to it (x2 for 2026-07-10), which is its figure on the earlier
 *            measure to the cent — the step was detected as exact. Each
 *            observation carries that link (linkOf), each period its
 *            earlier-measure level (`linked`), and growth across the change
 *            is taken between those. A model first listed after the change
 *            has no earlier figure to link to, so a period resting on one
 *            still refuses growth across the change, with a reason. Within
 *            one side growth is computed exactly as before.
 *
 * This is a read-time classification of the rows as received. Nothing is
 * stored or rewritten anywhere.
