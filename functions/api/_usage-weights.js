/**
 * Usage weights for provider price averages.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR
 * The provider pricing matrix averages a provider's lineup by (model, day)
 * observation: a model nobody calls counts as much as the one carrying the
 * traffic. That answers "what is on the menu", not "what does the market
 * actually pay". This module supplies the second answer by weighting each
 * model's price by the tokens it actually served, at the price in force at
 * the time it served them.
 *
 * WEIGHT SOURCE
 * /api/openrouter-chart-weekly — the weekly "Top Models" token series
 * captured from openrouter.ai/rankings. Each week carries
 * `allModels: { "<orProvider>/<model>": tokens }`. This is REAL observed
 * volume, not a survey or an estimate.
 *
 * THE HONESTY LIMITS — every one of them is surfaced in the response,
 * because a weighted average that hides its own coverage is worse than no
 * weighted average at all:
 *
 *   1. OpenRouter is a slice of the market, not the market. First-party API
 *      traffic (most of OpenAI's and Google's real volume) never appears.
 *      Weights describe OpenRouter's mix only.
 *
 *   2. OpenRouter's weekly chart names only its top ~9 models and buckets
 *      everything else into "Others". A provider whose traffic is spread
 *      across many mid-tier models is therefore under-represented, and
 *      "Others" cannot be split back out by provider. This is why coverage
 *      is measured and enforced rather than assumed — see gate below.
 *
 *   3. OpenRouter publishes ONE token count per model, prompt and completion
 *      combined. The same weight is therefore applied to the input average
 *      and the output average. A model whose traffic skews unusually far to
 *      one side is weighted slightly off on both.
 *
 *   4. Coverage needs a denominator — the provider's total OpenRouter
 *      tokens — from a separate capture (?providers=1). Two ways it can be
 *      incomplete, and both withhold rather than assume:
 *        a. A week of the quarter is missing from one of the two captures.
 *           Certifying a quarter on a subset of its weeks would publish a
 *           price averaged over more weeks than the coverage figure covers.
 *           Both directions count: a model week with no provider week, and
 *           a provider week with no model week.
 *        b. A provider is absent from a week's ranking, where OpenRouter
 *           folds it into `others`. Absence is not zero traffic, so that
 *           provider-quarter's denominator is short by an unknown amount
 *           and its coverage is unknowable — even though other providers
 *           in the same week are fine.
 *
 *   5. OpenRouter's `:free` variants serve tokens at no charge. Folding them
 *      into the paid SKU would count free traffic at the paid price and
 *      inflate a metric whose whole claim is "what was paid", so variant
 *      SKUs are excluded from the weights AND from the coverage numerator —
 *      they lower coverage, which is the visible, correct outcome.
 *
 *   6. Prices are taken from the week the tokens were served, not from a
 *      quarterly mean. A model repriced mid-quarter whose traffic is not
 *      uniform either side of the change would otherwise be charged a blend
 *      of the old and new price for all of its volume — which is not what
 *      anyone paid. Tokens in a week where the model carries no price are
 *      dropped and count against coverage.
 *
 * THE GATE
 * A weighted cell is published only when all of these hold:
 *   - the weight series was actually available;
 *   - at least MIN_WEIGHTED_MODELS priced models carry a weight, so the
 *     number is an average and not one model wearing a provider's name;
 *   - coverage is KNOWN for that provider-quarter; and
 *   - coverage is at least MIN_COVERAGE of the provider's own OpenRouter
 *     tokens.
 * Otherwise the cell is null and carries a `gate` string naming which test
 * it failed, so the UI can say why rather than showing a bare dash.
 *
 * Measured against live data on 2026-09-16, the slug reconciliation below
 * matches 100% of named OpenRouter tokens to a priced model for every week
 * at or after the pricing floor (2025-07-28); earlier weeks predate upstream
 * pricing entirely and match 0% by construction.

 * explicit for all eight so a future rename fails loudly here instead of
 * silently zeroing a provider's weights.
 *
 * `cohere` has no OpenRouter presence in any captured week — it is listed so
 * the omission is visibly deliberate rather than an oversight.

 *   claude-4.5-sonnet-…        → claude-sonnet-4.5   (tier/version swapped)
 *
 * Kept deliberately narrow: exact matching after these rewrites, never fuzzy
 * or prefix matching. A model we cannot name exactly is reported as unpriced
 * and drags coverage down — which is the correct, visible outcome. Guessing
 * would silently attach a wrong price to real volume.
