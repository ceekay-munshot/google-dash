/**
 * Cloudflare Pages Function — accumulated per-model OpenRouter usage.
 * Route: /api/openrouter-model-usage
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The weekly chart the dashboard has always used names only OpenRouter's top
 * ~9 models per week and rolls everything else into "Others". That is why
 * usage-weighted pricing could only ever cover 2–16% of OpenAI's volume, and
 * why most cells in that view are withheld: not because the weighting is
 * wrong, but because the weights describe a ninth of the market.
 *
 * OpenRouter's rankings API serves the full picture — ~500 models, with prompt
 * and completion tokens counted separately. Its one limitation is that it is a
 * ROLLING WINDOW, not a history: `view=week` returns the trailing seven days
 * and nothing older. Fetching it once tells you about now; fetching it every
 * week builds the history that does not otherwise exist.
 *
 * So this endpoint accumulates. Each qualifying capture is written to KV under
 * the ISO week it represents, and the accumulated set is served back as a
 * weekly series in the same shape as /api/openrouter-chart-weekly?full=1, so
 * the weighting layer can consume either without special-casing.
 *
 * WHICH CAPTURES QUALIFY, AND WHY THE DAY MATTERS
 * `view=week` is a trailing seven days from the moment you ask. Taken on a
 * Wednesday it spans Wed–Tue, which straddles two ISO weeks and matches
 * neither. Attributing that to a Monday-start week would silently misplace
 * several days of volume — the same class of error as splitting a partial week
 * across days that have not happened.
 *
 * A capture is therefore only stored as week W when it is taken on the Monday
 * or Tuesday after W ends, where the trailing seven days and W coincide (or
 * miss by one day). Captures on any other weekday are still reported for
 * freshness but are NOT stored as a week and never reach the weighting. The
 * daily capture schedule guarantees a qualifying capture every Monday.
 *
 * Verified against live data on 2026-09-16: the trailing-week total is 0.98x
 * the last complete market-share week, so the two sources describe the same
 * span and can be compared directly. (An earlier reading of 2.49x came from
 * comparing a full trailing week against market-share's two-day partial
 * current week — an artifact of the comparison, not a disagreement.)
 *
 * Query params:
 *   (none)      — serve the accumulated weekly series, newest last
 *   ?refresh=1  — fetch upstream now and store if the capture qualifies
 *   ?debug=1    — coverage, freshness and why the last capture did or did not
 *                 store, so this feed cannot rot unnoticed the way the two it
 *                 supersedes did
