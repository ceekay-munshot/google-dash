/**
 * Cloudflare Pages Function — Provider-Grouped Quarterly Pricing Matrix
 * Route: /api/provider-pricing-matrix
 * Method: GET
 *
 * Fan-out proxy against pricepertoken.com's public historical pricing API:
 *     https://api.pricepertoken.com/api/provider-pricing-history/?provider=<slug>
 *
 * That upstream endpoint returns ONE row per (model, day) with fields:
 *     provider, model, date, pricing_prompt, pricing_completion, ...
 *
 * We call it once per configured provider in parallel, aggregate into a
 * quarter-by-provider matrix of equal-weighted average input (or output)
 * price per 1M tokens, and return the matrix plus per-cell model counts
 * for transparency (so the reader can see how coverage shifts over time).
 *
 * This is DERIVED from a real live upstream — not local captured snapshots.
 * The matrix is cached at the CF edge for CACHE_TTL seconds.
 *
 * Honesty rules — the whole reason this exists:
 *   - No synthetic backfill. Quarters prior to the upstream's depth simply
 *     don't appear in the response.
 *   - Upstream's earliest date observed is 2025-07-28, so the historical
 *     floor is 2025-Q3 (partial). Client asked for 2023+; we do not fake it.
 *   - YoY is only returned when a same-quarter one year earlier row exists
 *     with real data.
 *   - A price CHANGE is like-for-like. QoQ and YoY compare the models a
 *     provider priced in BOTH quarters, each at its own average price in each,
 *     so a model listed or retired between them cannot read as a price move.
 *     The level stays the whole lineup's average — a true statement of what
 *     the lineup costs. Anthropic's 2026-Q3 read "-10.4%" and 2026-Q2
 *     "+55.9%" with not one of its models repriced: four models left the
 *     lineup, four joined, and the fourteen priced in both did not move.
 *     Fewer than two models priced in both is the only refusal; under half
 *     the lineup the change is still published, marked <key>LowMatchedShare
 *     with its counts so the screen can say "5 of 18 models like-for-like".
 *     Model-day view only. The usage-weighted view compares the levels it
 *     shows, measured or estimated, so its QoQ/YoY reconcile with its Avg
 *     cells; a change resting on an estimate says so (<key>Estimated,
 *     <key>Note).
 *   - The source can change WHAT it reports: on 2026-07-10 its figure for 13
 *     Google and 10 OpenAI models fell to exactly half on one day. Every price
 *     is read, and every quarter's measure decided, by _model-price-basis.js:
 *     a quarter averages one measure only, and QoQ/YoY between quarters on
 *     different measures are LINKED: each model the change moved enters at
 *     its reported price times the inverse of the change's exact factor, so
 *     both quarters stand on one measure (<key>Linked, <key>Note). Refused
 *     with a reason (<key>MeasureChanged / <key>Reason) only where too few
 *     models can be linked.
 *   - Every blank change carries a reason. A dash with nothing behind it is
 *     not an honest refusal — see the <key>* fields the QoQ/YoY pass writes.
 *
 * Query params:
 *   ?metric=input   (default) — pricing_prompt, scaled to per 1M tokens
 *   ?metric=output            — pricing_completion, scaled to per 1M tokens
 *   ?weight=equal   (default) — every model in the lineup counts once
 *   ?weight=usage             — each model counts in proportion to the tokens
 *                               it actually served on OpenRouter, so the cell
 *                               reads as what the market pays rather than what
 *                               the price list says. Coverage is measured per
 *                               provider-quarter and cells that cannot clear
 *                               the gate are withheld with a stated reason —
 *                               see _usage-weights.js for the limits.
 *   ?refresh=1                — bypass edge cache (diagnostic only)

 * A provider's price change between two quarters, LIKE-FOR-LIKE: measured on

 *
 * `cur` and `prior` are providerQuarterLevels() entries. Each matched model
 * enters at its own mean price in each quarter, and the change is the ratio of
 * the matched models' average prices:
 *
 *     growth = mean(matched, cur) / mean(matched, prior) - 1
 *
 * Why the ratio of averages, and not the mean of each model's own % change:
 *   - It is the change of the SAME statistic the cell shows as its level (an
 *     equal-weighted mean of $/token), held to one fixed lineup. With no model
 *     entering or leaving, and each priced every day, it is the figure the
 *     matrix has always printed, so what this removes is the lineup-mix
 *     artefact and nothing else.
 *   - It weighs each model's move by its price, as the level does. A mean of
 *     % changes (or their geometric mean) gives a $0.03 model the same say as
 *     a $15 one: DeepSeek's r1-distill-llama-70b went from $0.033 to $0.800 per
 *     1M input tokens between 2025-Q3 and 2026-Q3, which alone carries a mean
 *     of % changes to +318% against +73% for the matched models' average.
 *
 * Across the source's change of reporting (`linked`), each model enters at its
 * level on the earlier measure — its reported price times the inverse of the
 * exact factor the change applied to it (see linkOf in _model-price-basis.js)
 * — so both quarters stand on one measure. A model that cannot be linked (first
 * listed after the change) has no earlier-measure figure and is left out.
 *
 * Returns { growth, matched, models, onlyNow, onlyThen, moved, unlinked, thin }

 * for want of a link, thin says the matched set is under MIN_MATCHED_SHARE of

 * Overlay accumulated full-catalogue weeks onto the top-9 weekly chart.
 *
 * The chart names ~9 models a week and rolls the rest into "Others", which is
 * the real ceiling on usage-weighted coverage — it is why OpenAI can only ever
 * be measured at 2–16% of its own volume. /api/openrouter-model-usage banks the
 * full ~500-model ranking one completed week at a time; wherever it has a week,
 * that week's weights come from the full catalogue instead.
 *
 * Two things this fixes at once. Coverage stops being capped at whatever the
 * top-9 happened to include. And because the full catalogue counts prompt and
 * completion tokens separately, the INPUT average can be weighted by prompt
 * tokens and the OUTPUT average by completion tokens, rather than both sharing
 * one combined count as the chart forces.
 *
 * Weeks are keyed by ISO start and replaced wholesale, never blended: mixing a
 * 9-model numerator with a 500-model one inside a single week would produce a
 * coverage figure describing neither.
